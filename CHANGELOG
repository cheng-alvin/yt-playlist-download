Changes made before source code was integrated into Git version
control. Changes from final `CHANGELOG` documented onwards would
be documented in commit history.

- 2025-09-24: Initial release

- 2025-09-24 (2nd):
  - Fixed bugs where non-blocking event loop causes files to be
    processed repeatedly; now uses synchronous file system calls
    which mitigates the issue.
  - Allows downloads to be organized in a specified output directory.
  - Changed separators between artist, title, and album of unicode (U+200E)
    rather than commonly used `-`es to avoid conflict with content.
 
- 2025-09-25:
  - Remove explicit requirement to exit process where an error has been
    thrown to prevent blocking the whole download process.
  - Strip more async operations down into synchronous ones to prevent
    race conditions as previously observed.
